  abstract =     { \textit{R} has always provided an application
                  programming interface (API) for extensions. Based on
                  the \textit{C} language, it uses a number of macros
                  and other low-level constructs to exchange data
                  structures between the \textit{R} process and any
                  dynamically-loaded component modules authors added
                  to it. With the introduction of the \textit{Rcpp}
                  package, and its later refinements, this process has
                  become considerably easier yet also more robust. By
                  now, \textit{Rcpp} has become the most popular
                  extension mechanism for \textit{R}. This article
                  introduces \textit{Rcpp}, and illustrates with
                  several examples how the \textit{Rcpp Attributes}
                  mechanism in particular eases the transition of
                  objects between \textit{R} and \textit{C++} code.  },
