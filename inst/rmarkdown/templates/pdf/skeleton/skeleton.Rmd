## Introduction {#intro .unnumbered}

This *pinp is not PNAS* template started when the introduction to
[Rcpp](http://dirk.eddelbuettel.com/code/rcpp.html) by
\cite{10.7287/peerj.preprints.3188v1} was converted into this updated
[Rcpp Introduction](https://eddelbuettel.github.io/pinp/Rcpp-introduction.pdf)
vignette.  It is based on the
[pnas_article](https://github.com/rstudio/rticles/tree/master/inst/rmarkdown/templates/pnas_article)
template of the wonderful [rticles](https://github.com/rstudio/rticles)
package. The underlying LaTeX macros are from
[pnas.org](http://www.pnas.org/site/authors/latex.xhtml).

The remainder of the document carries over from the corresponding
[pnas_article](https://github.com/rstudio/rticles/tree/master/inst/rmarkdown/templates/pnas_article)
template document.

Some specific tips follow.  In general, for fine-tuning some knowledge of LaTeX is helpful.


## Author Affiliations {#author-affiliations .unnumbered}

Include department, institution, and complete address, with the
ZIP/postal code, for each author. Use lower case letters to match
authors with institutions, as shown in the example. Authors with an
ORCID ID may supply this information at submission.


## Format {#format .unnumbered}

Many authors find it useful to organize their manuscripts with the
following order of sections; Title, Author Affiliation, Keywords,
Abstract, Significance Statement, Results, Discussion, Materials and
methods, Acknowledgments, and References. Other orders and headings are
permitted.

## References {#references .unnumbered}

Here we differ from PNAS and suggest natbib.

References should be cited in author-year form; this will be done automatically
via bibtex. Use `\citet{}`, `\citep{}`, etc as usual,
e.g. \citet{belkin2002using} and \citet{berard1994embedding} and
\cite{coifman2005geometric}. All referencesshould be included in the main
manuscript file.

Prior to submission, authors who believe their manuscripts would benefit
from professional editing are encouraged to use a language-editing
service (see list at www.pnas.org/site/authors/language-editing.xhtml).
PNAS does not take responsibility for or endorse these services, and
their use has no bearing on acceptance of a manuscript for publication.

## Inline R Code {#inliner .unnumbered}

The PNAS sample code included a fixed PNG image here, but this document prefers
to show what R code do.

```{r figex, fig.width=3, fig.height=3, cache=TRUE, echo=FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(mtcars, aes(wt, mpg)) + geom_point(size=3, aes(colour=factor(cyl))) + theme(legend.position="none")
```

## Pretty Print Source Code {#sourcecode .unnumbered}

Because every R document needs some clustering.

```{r kmeans, fig.width=3, fig.height=3, cache=TRUE, echo=TRUE}
# a 2-dimensional example (cf ?kmeans)
x <- rbind(matrix(rnorm(100, sd = 0.3), ncol = 2),
           matrix(rnorm(100, mean = 1, sd = 0.3), 
                  ncol = 2))
colnames(x) <- c("x", "y")
cl <- kmeans(x, 2)
par(mar=c(3,3,1,1))
plot(x, col = cl$cluster)
points(cl$centers, col = 1:2, pch = 8, cex = 1)
```

## Digital Figures {#sec:figures .unnumbered}

Markdown, Pandoc and LaTeX support eps and pdf files.

Figures and Tables should be labelled and referenced in the standard way
using the `\label{}` and `\ref{}` commands.

The R examples above show how to insert a column-wide
figure. To insert a figure wider than one column, please use the
`\begin{figure*}...\end{figure*}` environment. Figures wider than one
column should be sized to 11.4 cm or 17.8 cm wide.

## Single column equations {#single-column-equations .unnumbered}

Authors may use 1- or 2-column equations in their article, according to
their preference.

To allow an equation to span both columns, options are to use the
`\begin{figure*}...\end{figure*}` environment mentioned above for
figures, or to use the `\begin{widetext}...\end{widetext}` environment
as shown in equation \[eqn:example\] below.

Please note that this option may run into problems with floats and
footnotes, as mentioned in the [cuted package
documentation](http://texdoc.net/pkg/cuted). In the case of problems
with footnotes, it may be possible to correct the situation using
commands `\footnotemark` and `\footnotetext`.

$$\begin{aligned}
(x+y)^3&=(x+y)(x+y)^2\\
       &=(x+y)(x^2+2xy+y^2) \label{eqn:example} \\
       &=x^3+3x^2y+3xy^3+x^3. 
\end{aligned}$$
